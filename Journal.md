Week 0 (18.05-25.05):

In the first week we want to come up with the high level milestones that are to be completed during this project. 

1 Only one region: 

Function that computes the number of susceptible/infected/recovered people as a function of time using the [SIR model](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-8-scipy/additional-examples/the-sir-epidemic-model/). We want to implement different scenarios such as number of people, interactions, ...

2 Several regions:

Simulate several regions that are in contact with each other. Region can be a country or a school etc. depending on the scale of our model.

3 Vaccinations:

Implement the impact of vaccines in the code. Compute the fraction of vaccinated people for erradication of the virus.
