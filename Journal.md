Diff. eq. for 2 populations:

Question: 

    -Simulation (with some randomness) -> if we find literature. + calculation?
    -Literature? -> review papers. stochastic diff. eq. (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07362994.2012.684319?needAccess=true). Google scholar: review. 
    -Real data? Took code from internet for first step (Problem?)
    -Weekly journal check? Make own milestones weekly. Get feedback. Not sure if grades. 
=======
Week 0 (18.05-25.05):

In the first week we want to come up with the high level milestones that are to be completed during this project. 

1 Only one region: 

Function that computes the number of susceptible/infected/recovered people as a function of time using the [SIR model](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-8-scipy/additional-examples/the-sir-epidemic-model/). We want to implement different scenarios such as number of people, interactions, ...

2 Several regions:

Simulate several regions that are in contact with each other. Region can be a country or a school etc. depending on the scale of our model.

3 Vaccinations:

Implement the impact of vaccines in the code. Compute the fraction of vaccinated people for erradication of the virus.
